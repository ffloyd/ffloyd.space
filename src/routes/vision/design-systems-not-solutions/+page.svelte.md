# Design Systems, Not Solutions

When faced with problems, often our instinct is to solve them one by one, with the most straightforward solution for each.
I saw noticable amount of cases when it led to _"50 different solutions for 50 different problems"_ situation.
Where each solution has its own quirks, edge cases, and maintenance burden.
Let's refer to this approach as **individual solutions**.

When **individual solutions** approach comes from or heavily affected by [availability bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic) - it becomes a real disaster.
When no deep thinking involved to overcome it - "disorder" and "it makes no sense" is the best word to explain results.

A really promising and rewarding approach in my opinion is to **design emergent systems** that naturally solve multiple problems at once.
Instead of building **individual solutions**, aim to design [a few interconnected concepts that together address a wider range of issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) including the original one.
I found that it's often possible to find emergent designs, that has similar or even lower development cost as **individual solutions**.

It's hard.
But extremely rewarding _in the long run._
