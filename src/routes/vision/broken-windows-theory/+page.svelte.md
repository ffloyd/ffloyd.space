# Broken Windows Theory Works

The "broken windows theory" suggests that visible signs of disorder and neglect in an
environment encourage further disorder and neglect. This concept can be _applied to software
development_, particularly in the **context of code quality** and technical debt.

The theory posits that if a broken window in a building is left
unrepaired, it signals to others that no one cares about the property, leading to more
vandalism and neglect. In software development, "broken windows" can be seen as messy,
poorly maintained code.

A messy codebase can lead to a negative feedback loop.
When developers encounter messy, poorly written, or "ugly" code, it can lead to a sense of
resignation or acceptance that such code is the norm. This mindset can result in further
deterioration of the codebase, as developers may feel less motivated to maintain desired quality bar.
