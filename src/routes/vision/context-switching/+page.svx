# Context-Switching Is a Plague

Every time you switch between tasks, your brain needs time to fully engage with the new context. Research shows it takes 15-25 minutes to fully restore deep focus after an interruption. Yet modern work culture normalizes constant context-switching.

We jump between:
- Multiple projects
- Different communication channels
- Unrelated meetings
- Emergency bug fixes
- Code reviews

Each switch has a cost. Not just the obvious time cost, but the **mental residue** from the previous task that lingers and interferes with the new one.

## The real damage

Context-switching does not just waste time. It prevents deep work, increases error rates, and leads to superficial understanding. You never dive deep enough to see the full picture.

**Protect your focus:**
- Batch similar tasks together
- Schedule dedicated blocks for deep work
- Minimize unnecessary meetings
- Reduce notification interruptions
- Finish one thing before starting another

It is insane that we normalized this. Context-switching should be the exception, not the rule.
