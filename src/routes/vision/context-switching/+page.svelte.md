# Context-Switching Is a Plague

Every time you switch between tasks, your brain needs time to fully engage with the new context. Research shows it takes 15-25 minutes to fully restore deep focus after an interruption. Yet modern work culture normalizes constant context-switching.

We jump between:

- Multiple projects
- Different communication channels
- Unrelated meetings
- Emergency bug fixes
- Code reviews

Each switch has a cost. Not just the obvious time cost, but the **mental residue** from the previous task that lingers and interferes with the new one.

## The real damage

Context-switching does not just waste time. It prevents deep work, increases error rates, and leads to superficial understanding. You never dive deep enough to see the full picture.
