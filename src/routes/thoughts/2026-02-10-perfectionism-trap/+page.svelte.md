# The Perfectionism Trap

Perfectionism masquerades as high standards. But they're not the same thing.

**Healthy striving** says: "This can be better, let me work on it."
**Perfectionism** says: "This isn't perfect, so it's worthless."

I've spent years in the second camp. Refactoring code that worked. Rewriting articles three times before publishing. Waiting for the "right moment" to share ideas.

The irony? Perfectionism is a form of procrastination. It gives you the feeling of working while actually preventing you from finishing anything.

In code, this manifests as:

- Endless refactoring of "messy" but working code
- Waiting for the "perfect" architecture before writing anything
- Abandoning projects because they're not "good enough"

The solution isn't to lower your standards. It's to change what you're optimizing for.

**Optimize for learning, not perfection.**
**Optimize for shipping, not polishing.**
**Optimize for progress, not completeness.**

Good enough, shipped, is infinitely better than perfect, unfinished.
