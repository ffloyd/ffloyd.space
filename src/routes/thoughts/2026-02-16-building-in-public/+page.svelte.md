# Building in Public

There is something terrifying and exhilarating about putting your work out there before it's "ready."

I've always been a perfectionist. My side projects lived in private repositories, polished until they were "good enough" — which, of course, they never were. They died in obscurity, victims of my endless polishing.

Building in public changes this. When others can see your work in progress, you:

1. **Ship faster** — perfectionism becomes a liability when people are watching
2. **Get feedback earlier** — assumptions get challenged before you've invested too much
3. **Connect with others** — you meet people on similar journeys
4. **Create accountability** — declarative statements become commitments

This website is an experiment in that philosophy. These thoughts are raw, unfiltered, and definitely not perfect. But they're here. They're real. And that's the point.

The worst that happens is someone disagrees with me. That's valuable. That's growth.
