# Learning in Public

The best way to learn is to teach. The best way to teach is to do it publicly.

I've always learned alone. Read books, consumed courses, built projects in isolation. It worked, but slowly. There was no feedback loop, no one to catch my mistakes, no one to learn from my mistakes.

Learning in public means:

- Writing about what you're learning as you learn it
- Sharing your mistakes and what they taught you
- Asking questions out loud instead of in your head
- Showing work-in-progress, not just finished results

The fear is obvious: what if I'm wrong? What if someone more experienced sees my beginner mistakes?

Here's the secret: everyone starts somewhere. Your "obvious" might be someone else's breakthrough. Your struggle might be exactly what someone else is struggling with right now.

This page exists because I want to learn faster. Writing forces clarity. Publishing creates accountability. Feedback accelerates growth.

If you're reading this and thinking "I could never share my incomplete thoughts" — that's exactly why you should.
